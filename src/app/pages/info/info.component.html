    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring software engineer based in South Africa, seeking a new
      role where I can contribute to an innovative team. My expertise lies in
      designing scalable systems, developing RESTful APIs, and creating
      efficient backend solutions using Java and Spring Boot. I also have
      experience with front-end development, particularly with Angular, ensuring
      seamless integration between client and server-side logic. I'm adaptable
      to new technologies and always eager to learn whatever tools are necessary
      for the job. Feel free to take a look at my projects â€“ I'd love to hear
      from you!
